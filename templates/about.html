    <b>Info:</b> Morse code is a method of telecommunication in which text characters are expressed through the combination of 2 different signals: "dots" and "dashes". The duration of
    a dot is 1 unit, while the duration of a dash is 3 units. The space betwen parts of the same letter is one unit; the space between different letters is 3 units; the space between different
    words is 7 units.

      <b>History:</b> The morse code system is named after Samuel Morse, who invented the telegraph during the 1930s. In a time when technology was not advanced enough to transmit human voices,
      the telegraph allowed for long-distance communication through the use of morse code. Morse code was crucial during times like WWII, the Korean and Vietnam Wars, and more. Morse code required
      operators who could quickly express and decipher phrases in morse codee, which required an immense amount of practice.
